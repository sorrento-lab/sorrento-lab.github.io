### Sorrento-Lab: a journal of building a homelab using OrangeFR 2Gbps fibre, Proxmox, OPNsense, UnRaid and more...

This log serves as a reference for myself and those who also want to to set up a homelab taking advantage of fibre offers (OrangeFR in my case) above 1Gbps using an SFP+ PCIe add-in card, and an always on home server. The implementation detailed in this journal uses Proxmox as a bare metal host, and OPNsense and UnRaid guest VMs. I am not using a VOIP phone - however I have provided some links in the references sections for OPNsense.

I have to stress almost all of the information here has been collected from multiple sources - many people who have given hours of thought on how to achieve what is described here. I have referenced these items as best I could as both a credit to the original persons and as a point of further reading.

Finally - I have also detailed other technical procedures in this log that may be unrelated to the homelab.
