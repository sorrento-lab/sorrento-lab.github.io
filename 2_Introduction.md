## 2. Introduction, Hardware Specs and Network Map

My user profile is a small apartment, 2x people, with <25 devices, including IoT. As my homelab is located in my living room there was a focus on low heat/power.

I used the following hardware to develop a home-lab network with internet throughput >1Gbps:
* OrangeFR OpenUp Fibre subscription, which includes Livebox5 and UHD-TV box. As of writing this plan is 2200/600 Mbps down/up.
* Custom home server, comprising of:
  * i5-10600T on a AsRock Z490m-ITX motherboard
  * 64GB RAM
  * 2x 1TB NVME 970 evo plus
  * 4x 1.92TB PM863a Samsung SSDs
  * Dell N20KJ BCM57810S Broadcom card (2x SFP+ ports) (86eur on ebay)
  * Nokia-Alcatel G-010S-A SFP ONT (55eur on aliexpress)
